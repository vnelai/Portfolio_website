            <h3>My Journey</h3>
            <p>After completing high school in Greece, I moved to New York with the goal of pursuing a pre-med 
                track in college. Driven by strong academic performance and family expectations, medicine appeared 
                to be a stable path for growth. However, unforeseen circumstances required me to care for my two 
                younger siblings, making it challenging to balance my studies. As a result, I redirected my efforts 
                toward multiple jobs to provide a stable foundation for my family.
            </p>
            <p>
                My career journey began as a shift supervisor at an adult home, where I found deep satisfaction 
                in helping others. I then transitioned to a role at a music venue, starting as an inventory manager 
                and advancing to director of operations for retail, events, and music operations. In this position, 
                I honed my organizational skills and leadership abilities while cultivating a passion for data and 
                technology. Recognizing the need for further certification to align my skills with equitable 
                opportunities, I completed Google’s Data Analytics certification, which reignited my interest 
                in math and opened the door to the tech field. Eager to learn more, I delved into cybersecurity 
                and software engineering, earning several certifications through self-study. I later enrolled 
                in a software engineering bootcamp, gaining hands-on experience with the MERN stack and project 
                management. Additionally, I worked as an Admitting Representative in the emergency department 
                of a well-renowned hospital, where I gained insights into the healthcare industry and finance 
                operations. This experience taught me how to thrive in a fast-paced, high-pressure environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, equipped with knowledge in both cybersecurity and software engineering, I’m actively 
                working on projects to deepen my skills and secure my first role in tech. My next goal is to 
                pursue a master’s degree in computer science, completing a journey that has come full circle—from 
                healthcare to a genuine passion for technology, driven by resilience and adaptability.
