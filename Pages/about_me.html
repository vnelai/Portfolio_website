    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h3>My Journey</h3>
    <p>After completing high school in Greece, I moved to New York with the goal of pursuing a pre-med 
        track in college. Driven by strong academic performance and family expectations, medicine appeared 
        to be a stable path for growth. However, unforeseen circumstances required me to care for my two 
        younger siblings, making it challenging to balance my studies. As a result, I redirected my efforts 
        toward multiple jobs to provide a stable foundation for my family.

        My career journey began as a shift supervisor at an adult home, where I found deep satisfaction 
        in helping others. I then transitioned to a role at a music venue, starting as an inventory manager 
        and advancing to director of operations for retail, events, and music operations. In this position, 
        I honed my organizational skills and leadership abilities while cultivating a passion for data and 
        technology. Recognizing the need for further certification to align my skills with equitable 
        opportunities, I completed Google’s Data Analytics certification, which reignited my interest 
        in math and opened the door to the tech field. Eager to learn more, I delved into cybersecurity 
        and software engineering, earning several certifications through self-study. I later enrolled 
        in a software engineering bootcamp, gaining hands-on experience with the MERN stack and project 
        management. Additionally, I worked as an Admitting Representative in the emergency department 
        of a well-renowned hospital, where I gained insights into the healthcare industry and finance 
        operations. This experience taught me how to thrive in a fast-paced, high-pressure environment.

        Today, equipped with knowledge in both cybersecurity and software engineering, I’m actively 
        working on projects to deepen my skills and secure my first role in tech. My next goal is to 
        pursue a master’s degree in computer science, completing a journey that has come full circle—from 
        healthcare to a genuine passion for technology, driven by resilience and adaptability.
